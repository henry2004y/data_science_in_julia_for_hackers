Nobody likes spam emails. How can Bayes help? In this chapter, we'll
introduce a simple yet effective way of using Bayesian probability to
create a spam filter. The filter will examine emails and classify them
as either spam or ham (the word for non-spam emails) based on their
content.

The term spam has its origins in the 1970s, in a sketch from the British
comedy troupe Monty Python (who also inspired the name of the Python
programming language). In this sketch from the series *Monty Python's
Flying Circus*, a customer wants to order food at a restaurant, but as
the waitress begins to loudly recite the menu, the word *spam* starts to
appear with increasing frequency, to the point of absurdity. Eventually
all meaning is lost, and the waitress is just shouting *spam, spam,
spam* . . . which is often what an email inbox feels like.

## The Training Data

For the Bayesian spam filter to work correctly, we need to feed it some
good training data. In this context, that means having a large enough
corpus of emails that have been pre-classified as spam or ham. The
emails should be collected from a sufficiently heterogeneous group of
people. After all, spam is a somewhat subjective category: one person's
spam may be another person's ham. The proportion of spam vs. ham in our
data should also be somewhat representative of the real proportion of
emails we receive.

Fortunately, there are a lot of very good datasets available online.
We'll use the "Email Spam Classification Dataset CSV" from
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/balaka18/email-spam-classification-dataset-csv)
a website where data science enthusiasts and practitioners publish
datasets, participate in competitions, and share their knowledge. The
dataset's description included online helps us make sense of its
contents:

> The .csv file contains 5,172 rows, one row for each email. There are
> 3,002 columns. The first column indicates Email name. The name has
> been set with numbers and not recipients' name to protect privacy. The
> last column has the labels for prediction: \lstinline{1} for spam,
> \lstinline{0} for not spam. The remaining 3,000 columns are the 3,000
> most common words in all the emails, after excluding the
> non-alphabetical characters/words. For each row, the count of each
> word(column) in that email(row) is stored in the respective cells.

Let's take a look at the data. The following code snippet outputs a view
of the first and last rows of the dataset.

```{julia}
raw_df = CSV.File("./04_naive_bayes/data/emails.csv") |> DataFrame 
```

As you can see, the output informs the amount of rows and columns and
the type of each column and allows us to see a sample of the data.

## Preprocessing the Data

Before we use the data to train our filter, we need to preprocess it a
little bit. First, we should filter out very common words, such as
articles and pronouns, which will most likely add noise rather than
information to our classification algorithm.

        all_words = names(raw_df)[2:end-1];
        all_words_text = StringDocument(join(all_words, " "))
        prepare!(all_words_text, strip_articles)
        prepare!(all_words_text, strip_pronouns)
        vocabulary = filter(x -> x != "", split(TextAnalysis.text(all_words_text)))
        clean_words_df = raw_df[!, vocabulary]
        # the columns of this matrix will be each email now
        data_matrix = Matrix(clean_words_df)'
    end

To filter out common words, we use two Julia packages specially designed
for working with texts of any type: Languages.jl and TextAnalysis.jl.

Next, we need to divide the data in two: a training set and a testing
set. This is standard practice when working with models that learn from
data, like the one we're going to implement. We train the model with the
training set, then evaluate the model's accuracy by having it make
predictions on the testing set. In Julia, the package MLDataUtils.jl has
some nice functionalities for data manipulations like this.

    begin
        labels = raw_df.Prediction
        (x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = splitobs(shuffleobs((data_matrix, labels)), at = 0.7)
    end

The function `splitobs` splits our dataset into a training set and a
testing set, and `shuffleobs` randomizes the order of the data in the
split. We pass a `labels` array to our split function so it knows how to
properly split the dataset. Now we can turn our attention to building
the spam filter.

## The Naive Bayes Approach

As we mentioned, what we are facing here is a *classification* problem,
and we will code from scratch and use a *supervised learning* algorithm
to find a solution with the help of Bayes' theorem. We're going to use a
*naive Bayes* classifier to create our spam filter. We're going to use a
\emph{naive Bayes} classifier to create our spam filter. This method is
going to treat each email just as a collection of words, with no regard
for the order in which they appear. This means we won't take into
account semantic considerations like the particular relationship between
words and their context.

Our strategy will be to estimate a probability of an incoming email
being ham or spam and make a decision based on that. Our general
approach can be summarized as:

$P(spam|email) \propto P(email|spam)P(spam)$

$P(ham|email) \propto P(email|ham)P(ham)$

Notice we use the $\propto$ sign, meaning *proportional to*, instead of
the = sign because the denominator from Bayes's theorem is missing. In
this case, we won't need to calculate it, as it's the same for both
probabilities and all we're going to care about is a comparison of these
two probabilities.

In this naive approach, where semantics aren't taken into account and
each email is just a collection of words, the conditional probability
$P(email|spam)$ means the probability that a given email can be
generated with the collection of words that appear in the spam category
of our data. Let's take a quick example. Imagine for a moment that our
training set of emails consists just of these three emails, all labeled
as spam:

-   Email 1: 'Are you interested in buying my product?'
-   Email 2: 'Congratulations! You've won \$1000!'
-   Email 3: 'Check out this product!'

Also imagine we receive a new, unclassified email and we want to
discover $P(email|spam)$. The new email looks like this:

-   New email: 'Apply and win all these products!'

The new email contains the words *win* and *product*, which are rather
common in our example's training data. We would therefore expect
$P(email|spam)$, the probability of the new email being generated by the
words encountered in the training spam email set, to be relatively high.

(The word \\emph{win} appears in the form \\emph{won} in the training
set, but that's OK. The standard linguistic technique of
\\emph{lemmatization} groups together any related forms of a word and
treats them as the same word.)

Mathematically, the way to calculate $P(email|spam)$ is to take each
word in our target email, calculate the probability of it appearing in
spam emails based on our training set, and multiply those probabilties
together.

$P(email|spam) = \prod_{i=1}^{n}P(word_i|spam)$

We use a similar calculation to determine $P(email|ham)$, the
probability of the new email being generated by the words encountered in
the training ham email set:

$P(email|ham) = \prod_{i=1}^{n}P(word_i|ham)$

The multiplication of each of the probabilities associated with a
particular word here stems from the naive assumption that all the words
in the email are statistically independent. In reality, this assumption
isn't necessarily true. In fact, it's most likely false. Words in a
language are never independent from one another, but this simple
assumption seems to be enough for the level of complexity our problem
requires.

The probability of a given word $word_i$ being in a given category is
calculated like so:

$$P(word_i|spam) = \frac{N_{word_i|spam} + \alpha}{N_{spam} + \alpha N_{vocabulary}}$$
$$P(word_i|ham) = \frac{N_{word_i|ham} + \alpha}{N_{ham} + \alpha N_{vocabulary}}$$

These formulas tell us exactly what we have to calculate from our data.
We need the numbers $N_{word_i|spam}$ and $N_{word_i|ham}$ for each
word, meaning the number of times that $word_i$ is used in the spam and
ham categories, respectively. $N_{spam}$ and $N_{ham}$ are the total
number of words used in the spam and ham categories (including all word
repetitions), and $N_{vocabulary}$ is the total number of unique words
in the dataset. The variable $\alpha$ is a smoothing parameter that
prevents the probability of a given word being in a given category from
going down to zero. If a given word hasn't appeared in the spam category
in our training dataset, for example, we don't want to assign it zero
probability of appearing in new spam emails.

As all of this information will be specific to our dataset, a clever way
to aggregate it is to use a Julia *struct*, with attributes for the
pieces of data we'll need to access over and over during the prediction
process. Here's the implementation:

    mutable struct BayesSpamFilter
        words_count_ham::Dict{String, Int64}
        words_count_spam::Dict{String, Int64}
        N_ham::Int64
        N_spam::Int64
        vocabulary::Array{String}
        BayesSpamFilter() = new()
    end

The relevant attributes of the struct are `words_count_ham` and
`words_count_spam`, two dictionaries containing the frequency of
appearance of each word in the ham and spam datasets; `N_ham` and
`N_spam`, the total number of words appearing in each category; and
`vocabulary`, an array of all the unique words in the dataset.

The line `BayesSpamFilter() = new()` is the constructor of this struct.
Because the constructor is empty, all the attributes will be undefined
when we instantiate the filter. We'll have to define some functions to
fill these variables with values that are relevant to our particular
problem. First, here's a function `word_count` that counts the
occurrences of each word in the ham and spam categories.

    function words_count(word_data, vocabulary, labels, spam=0)
        # word_data is a matrix where each column is an email and each row is a word
        count_dict = Dict{String, Int64}()
        n_emails = size(word_data)[2]
        for (i, word) in enumerate(vocabulary)
            count_dict[word] = sum([word_data[i,j] for j in 1:n_emails if labels[j]==spam])
        end
        return count_dict
    end

Next, we'll define a `fit!` function for our spam filter struct. Notice
we're using the bang (`!`) convention here to indicate a function that
modifies its arguments in-place (in this case, the spam filter struct
itself). This function *fits* our model to the data, a typical procedure
in data science and machine learning areas.

    function fit!(model::BayesSpamFilter, x_train, y_train, voc)
        model.vocabulary = voc
        model.words_count_ham = words_count(x_train, model.vocabulary, y_train, 0)
        model.words_count_spam = words_count(x_train, model.vocabulary, y_train, 1)
        model.N_ham = sum(values(model.words_count_ham))
        model.N_spam = sum(values(model.words_count_spam))
        return
    end

This function fills in all the undefined parameters in our struct. We
mainly use the `words_count` function we defined earlier. Notice that
we're only fitting the model to the training portion of the data, since
we're reserving the testing portion to evaluate the model's accuracy.

## Training the Model

Now it's time to instantiate our spam filter and fit the model to the
training data. With the struct and helper functions we've defined, the
process is quite straightforward.

    begin
        # here we instantiate the Bayes filter and then we fit it to our data
        spam_filter = BayesSpamFilter()
        fit!(spam_filter, x_train, y_train, vocabulary)
    end

We create an instance of our `BayesSpamFilter` struct and pass it to our
`fit!` function along with the data. Notice that we're only passing in
the training portion of the dataset, since we want to reserve the
testing portion to evaluate the model's accuracy later.

## Making Predictions

Now that we have our model, we can use it to make some spam vs. ham
predictions and assess its performance. We'll define a few more
functions to help with this process. First, we need a function
implementing the TAL formula that we discussed earlier.

    function word_spam_probability(word, words_count_ham, words_count_spam, N_ham,
            N_spam, n_vocabulary, α
        ham_prob = (words_count_ham[word] + α)/(N_ham + α*(n_vocabulary))
        spam_prob = (words_count_spam[word] + α)/(N_spam + α*(n_vocabulary))
        return ham_prob, spam_prob
    end

This function calculates $P(word_i|spam)$ and $P(word_i|ham)$ for a
given word. We'll call it for each word of an incoming email within
another function, `spam_predict`, to calculate the probability of that
email being spam or ham.

    function spam_predict(email, model::BayesSpamFilter, α, tol=100)
        ngrams_email = ngrams(StringDocument(email))
        email_words = keys(ngrams_email)
        n_vocabulary = length(model.vocabulary)
        ham_prior = model.N_ham/(model.N_ham + model.N_spam)
        spam_prior = model.N_spam/(model.N_ham + model.N_spam)
        if length(email_words) > tol
            word_freq = values(ngrams_email)
            sort_idx = sortperm(collect(word_freq), rev=true)
            email_words = collect(email_words)[sort_idx][1:tol]
        end
        
        email_ham_probability = BigFloat(1)
        email_spam_probability = BigFloat(1)
        

        for word in intersect(email_words, model.vocabulary)
            word_ham_prob, word_spam_prob = word_spam_probability(word, model.words_count_ham, 
                   model.words_count_spam, model.N_ham, model.N_spam, n_vocabulary, α
            email_ham_probability *= word_ham_prob
            email_spam_probability *= word_spam_prob
        end
        return ham_prior*email_ham_probability, spam_prior*email_spam_probability
    end

This function takes as input a new email that we want to classify as
spam or ham, our fitted model, an $α$ value (which we've already
discussed), and a tolerance value `tol`. The latter sets the maximum
number of unique words in an email that we'll look at. We saw that the
calculations for $P(email|spam)$ and $P(email|ham)$ require the
multiplication of each $P(word_i|spam)$ and $P(word_i|ham)$ term. When
emails consist of a large number of words, this multiplication may lead
to very small probabilities, up to the point that the computer
interprets those probabilities as zero. This isn't desirable; we need
values of $P(email|spam)$ and $P(email|ham)$ that are larger than zero
in order to multiply them by $P(spam)$ and $P(ham)$, respectively, and
compare these values to make a prediction. To avoid probabilities of
zero, we'll only consider up to the `tol` most frequently used words in
the email.

    begin
        # this cell is just for testing
        mail_num = 56
        email = string([repeat(string(word, " "), n) for (word, n) in 
            zip(vocabulary, x_test[:,mail_num])]...);
        #nospam_prob, spam_prob = spam_predict(email, train_nospam, train_spam, 
            N_nospam, N_spam, vocabulary, 1)
        ham_prob, spam_prob = spam_predict(email, spam_filter, 1)
        @show ham_prob
        @show spam_prob
        y_test[mail_num]
    end

Finally, we arrive to the point of actually testing our model. We create
another function to manage the process. This function classifies each
email into Ham (represented by the number 0) or Spam (represented by the
number 1)

    function get_predictions(x_test, y_test, model::BayesSpamFilter, α, tol=200)
     N = length(y_test)
      predictions = Array{Int64, 1}(undef,N)
      for i in 1:N
        email = string([repeat(string(word, " "),N) for (word,N) in 
                zip(model.vocabulary, x_test[:, i])]...)
        pham, pspam = spam_predict(email, model, α, tol)
        pred = argmax([pham, pspam]) - 1
        predictions[i] = pred
      end
      return predictions
    end

This function takes in the testing portion of the data and our trained
model. We call our `spam_predict` function for each email in the testing
data and use the maximum (`argmax`) of the two returned probability
values to predict (`pred`) if the email is spam or ham. We return the
predictions as an array of values, which will contain zeros for ham
emails, and ones for spam emails. Here we call the function to make
predictions about the test data:

    predictions = get_predictions(x_test, y_test, spam_filter, 1)

Let's take a look at the predicted classifications of just the first
five emails in the test data.

    predictions[1:5]

Of the first five emails, one (the third) was classified as spam, and
the rest were classified as ham.

# Evaluating the Accuracy

Looking at the predictions themselves is pretty meaningless; what we
really want to know is the model's accuracy. We'll define another
function to calculate this.

    function spam_filter_accuracy(predictions, actual)
     N = length(predictions)
      correct = sum(predictions .== actual)
      accuracy = correct /N
      return accuracy
    end

This function compares the predicted classifications with the actual
classifications of the test data, counts the number of correct
predictions, and divides this number by the total number of test emails,
giving us an accuracy measurement. Here we call the function:

    spam_filter_accuracy(predictions, y_test)

The output indicates our model is about 95 percent accurate. It appears
our model is performing very well! Such a high accuracy rate is quite
astonishing for a model so naive and simple. In fact, it may be a little
too good to be true, because we have to take into account one more
thing. Our model classifies emails into spam or ham, but the amount of
ham emails in our data set is considerably higher than the spam ones.
Let's see the percentages:

    sum(x_train)/length(x_train)

This tells us that only 36 percent of the emails in the training set are
spam. This type of classification problem, where there's an unequal
distribution of classes in the dataset, is called *imbalanced*. With
unbalanced data, a better way to see how the model is performing is to
construct a *confusion matrix*, an $N \times N$ matrix, where $N$ is the
number of target classes (in our case, 2, for spam and ham). The matrix
compares the actual values for each class with those predicted by the
model. Here's a function that builds a confusion matrix for our spam
filter:

    function spam_filter_confusion_matrix(y_test,predictions)
        
        confusion_matrix = [0 0 ; 0 0]
        
        confusion_matrix[1,1] = sum(isequal(y_test[i],0) & isequal(predictions[i],0) for i in
                  1:length(y_test))
        confusion_matrix[1,2] = sum(isequal(y_test[i],1) & isequal(predictions[i],0) for i in 
                    1:length(y_test))
        confusion_matrix[2,1] = sum(isequal(y_test[i],0) & isequal(predictions[i],1) for i in
                    1:length(y_test))
        confusion_matrix[2,2] = sum(isequal(y_test[i],1) & isequal(predictions[i],1) for i in 
                    1:length(y_test))
        
        #Now we convert the confusion matrix into a DataFrame 
        confusion_df = DataFrame(Prediction = String[],
                    Ham_mail = Int64[],
                    Spam_mail = Int64[])

        confusion_df = vcat(confusion_df,DataFrame(Prediction = "Model predicted Ham", Ham_mail = 
                     confusion_matrix[1,1] , Spam_mail = confusion_matrix[1,2]))

        confusion_df = vcat(confusion_df ,DataFrame(Prediction = "Model predicted Spam", Ham_mail = 
                      confusion_matrix[2,1] , Spam_mail = confusion_matrix[2,2]))
        
        return confusion_df
        
    end

Now let's call our function to build the confusion matrix for our model.

`confusion_matrix = spam_filter_confusion_matrix(y_test[:],predictions)`

Row 1 of the confusion matrix shows us all the times our model
classified emails to be ham; 1,056 of those classifications were correct
and 36 were incorrect. Similarly, the `Spam_mail` column shows us the
classifications for all the spam emails; 36 were misidentified as ham,
and 427 were correctly identified as spam.

Now that we have the confusion matrix, we can calculate the accuracy of
the model segmented by category.

    ham_accuracy = confusion_matrix[1,"Ham_mail"]/(confusion_matrix[1,"Ham_mail"] + confusion_matrix[2,"Ham_mail"])

    spam_accuracy = confusion_matrix[2,"Spam_mail"]/(confusion_matrix[1,"Spam_mail"] + confusion_matrix[2,"Spam_mail"])

## Summary

In this chapter, we've used a naive Bayes approach to build a simple
email spam filter. We walked through the whole process of training,
testing, and evaluating a learning model. First, we obtained a dataset
of emails already classified as spam or ham and preprocessed the data.
Then we considered the theoretical framework for our naive analysis.
Using Bayes's theorem on the data available, we assigned a probability
of belonging to a spam or ham email to each word of the email dataset.
The probability of a new email being classified as spam is therefore the
product of the probabilities of each of its constituent words. We
defined a Julia `struct` for the spam filter object and created
functions to fit the spam filter object to the data. Finally, we made
predictions on new data and evaluated our model's performance by
calculating the accuracy and making a confusion matrix.
